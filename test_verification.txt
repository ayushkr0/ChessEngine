PROMOTION INTEGRATION VERIFICATION
=================================

Task 5: Integrate promotion logic into move execution

✓ COMPLETED SUB-TASKS:

1. Modify MovePiece method to detect and handle pawn promotion
   - Added promotion detection: if (type == "P" && RequiresPromotion(toRow, color))
   - Calls HandlePawnPromotion for human players (isAI = false)
   - Located after move validation but before turn switch
   - File: ChessBoard.cs, lines 218-223

2. Ensure promotion occurs after move validation but before turn switch
   - Promotion check is placed after kingInCheck validation
   - Promotion occurs before currentTurn switch
   - Atomic board state update maintained
   - File: ChessBoard.cs, MovePiece method

3. Update board state atomically with promoted piece
   - HandlePawnPromotion method updates board[toRow, toCol] directly
   - Original pawn is already moved to target square before promotion
   - Promoted piece replaces pawn in single atomic operation
   - File: ChessBoard.cs, HandlePawnPromotion method

4. Write integration tests for promotion during normal gameplay
   - Created TestPromotionIntegration.cs with comprehensive tests
   - Created TestPromotionIntegrationSimple.cs for basic verification
   - Created VerifyPromotionIntegration.cs for manual testing
   - Tests cover human and AI promotion flows

✓ ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:

5. Created MovePieceAI method for AI-specific promotion handling
   - Separate method for AI moves to ensure isAI flag is set correctly
   - AI automatically promotes to Queen without user interaction
   - Integrated with MakeBestAIMove method
   - File: ChessBoard.cs, lines 253-290

✓ REQUIREMENTS VERIFICATION:

Requirement 1.1: White pawn moves to rank 8 triggers promotion
- ✓ RequiresPromotion(toRow, color) checks (color == "W" && toRow == 0)

Requirement 1.2: Black pawn moves to rank 1 triggers promotion  
- ✓ RequiresPromotion(toRow, color) checks (color == "B" && toRow == 7)

Requirement 2.3: Piece selection replaces pawn with chosen piece
- ✓ HandlePawnPromotion calls CreatePromotedPiece and updates board

Requirement 3.3: Game flow continues correctly after promotion
- ✓ Turn switches after promotion (currentTurn = currentTurn == "W" ? "B" : "W")

✓ INTEGRATION POINTS:

1. MovePiece method (human players)
   - Detects pawn promotion after move validation
   - Calls HandlePawnPromotion with isAI = false
   - Maintains game flow with turn switching

2. MovePieceAI method (AI players)  
   - Detects pawn promotion after move execution
   - Calls HandlePawnPromotion with isAI = true
   - Automatic Queen promotion without user interaction

3. MakeBestAIMove method
   - Updated to call MovePieceAI instead of MovePiece
   - Ensures AI promotion is handled correctly

✓ TASK STATUS: COMPLETED

All sub-tasks have been implemented and integrated into the move execution flow.
The promotion logic is properly integrated after move validation but before turn switch.
Board state is updated atomically with the promoted piece.
Integration tests have been written to verify the functionality.
