# En Passant Requirements Document

## Introduction

En Passant is a special pawn capture rule in chess that allows a pawn to capture an opponent's pawn under specific conditions. This feature will complete the pawn movement rules in our chess engine, ensuring full compliance with standard chess rules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: En Passant Capture Detection

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to be able to capture an opponent's pawn via en passant when the conditions are met, so that I can follow standard chess rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an opponent's pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position AND my pawn is on the same rank adjacent to the moved pawn THEN the system SHALL allow en passant capture on the next move only
2. WHEN I attempt an en passant capture AND the conditions are not met THEN the system SHALL reject the move as invalid
3. WHEN an en passant capture is valid AND I execute the move THEN the system SHALL remove both my pawn from its original position and the opponent's pawn that moved two squares

### Requirement 2: Move Validation Integration

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want en passant moves to be properly validated within the existing move system, so that the game maintains consistency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I attempt an en passant move THEN the system SHALL validate it using the same move validation pipeline as other moves
2. WHEN an en passant move would leave my king in check THEN the system SHALL reject the move
3. WHEN an en passant capture is executed THEN the system SHALL update the board state atomically

### Requirement 3: Turn-Based Timing

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want en passant to only be available immediately after the opponent's two-square pawn move, so that the rule follows standard chess timing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an opponent makes a two-square pawn move THEN the system SHALL mark that pawn as capturable via en passant for the next turn only
2. WHEN any other move is made after a two-square pawn move THEN the system SHALL remove the en passant opportunity
3. WHEN multiple pawns could potentially be captured via en passant THEN the system SHALL track each opportunity independently

### Requirement 4: AI Integration

**User Story:** As a player against the AI, I want the AI to understand and use en passant moves appropriately, so that it plays according to standard chess rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI has an opportunity to capture via en passant THEN the system SHALL include this move in the AI's move generation
2. WHEN the AI evaluates en passant moves THEN the system SHALL consider the tactical value of the capture
3. WHEN the AI makes an en passant capture THEN the system SHALL execute it correctly without user interaction

### Requirement 5: Game State Consistency

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want en passant moves to maintain proper game state, so that the game continues correctly after the capture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an en passant capture is made THEN the system SHALL remove exactly two pawns from the board (capturing and captured)
2. WHEN an en passant capture is made THEN the system SHALL place the capturing pawn in the correct destination square
3. WHEN an en passant capture is made THEN the system SHALL switch turns normally after the move
4. WHEN an en passant capture is made THEN the system SHALL clear any previous en passant opportunities

### Requirement 6: Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want clear feedback when en passant captures occur, so that I understand what happened on the board.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an en passant capture is executed THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the special capture
2. WHEN I attempt an invalid en passant move THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message explaining why it's invalid
3. WHEN the board is displayed after en passant THEN the system SHALL show the correct final position with both pawns removed appropriately
