# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create promotion detection logic

  - Add `RequiresPromotion` method to detect when a pawn reaches promotion rank
  - Modify `IsValidPawnMove` to check for promotion conditions
  - Write unit tests for promotion detection with white and black pawns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement piece selection interface for human players

  - Create `GetPromotionChoice` method to prompt user for piece selection
  - Add input validation for Q, R, B, N piece types (case insensitive)
  - Handle invalid input with re-prompting and clear error messages
  - Write unit tests for piece selection validation
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Create promoted piece generation logic

  - Implement `CreatePromotedPiece` method to generate piece strings
  - Ensure promoted pieces match pawn color (W/B prefix)
  - Validate piece creation for all four promotion options
  - Write unit tests for piece string generation
  - _Requirements: 2.4_

- [x] 4. Implement promotion handler orchestration

  - Create `HandlePawnPromotion` method to coordinate promotion process
  - Integrate human player piece selection flow
  - Implement automatic Queen promotion for AI players
  - Write unit tests for both human and AI promotion flows
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 5. Integrate promotion logic into move execution

  - Modify `MovePiece` method to detect and handle pawn promotion
  - Ensure promotion occurs after move validation but before turn switch
  - Update board state atomically with promoted piece
  - Write integration tests for promotion during normal gameplay
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Update AI move generation for promotion moves

  - Modify `MakeBestAIMove` to handle promotion moves correctly
  - Ensure AI automatically promotes to Queen without user interaction
  - Test AI promotion in minimax search scenarios
  - Write tests for AI promotion during gameplay
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 7. Verify multiple Queens support

  - Test that multiple Queens of same color can exist on board
  - Ensure board evaluation correctly handles multiple Queens
  - Verify promoted pieces have correct movement capabilities
  - Write tests for scenarios with multiple promoted pieces
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive integration tests

  - Create end-to-end tests for complete promotion scenarios
  - Test promotion while in check situations
  - Test promotion that delivers checkmate
  - Verify game flow continues correctly after promotion
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_
