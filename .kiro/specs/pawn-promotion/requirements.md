## Introduction

Pawn Promotion is a special rule in chess that allows a pawn to be promoted to another piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight) when it reaches the opponent's back rank (the 8th rank for white, 1st rank for black). This feature is mandatory in chess and must be implemented to ensure the chess engine follows official chess rules.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want my pawn to be automatically promoted when it reaches the opponent's back rank, so that I can continue playing according to official chess rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a white pawn moves to rank 8 THEN the system SHALL trigger the promotion process
2. WHEN a black pawn moves to rank 1 THEN the system SHALL trigger the promotion process
3. WHEN promotion is triggered THEN the system SHALL NOT allow the pawn to remain as a pawn

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to choose which piece my pawn promotes to, so that I can make strategic decisions based on the game situation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN promotion is triggered THEN the system SHALL present options for Queen, Rook, Bishop, and Knight
2. WHEN a human player is promoting THEN the system SHALL pause the game and wait for piece selection
3. WHEN a piece is selected THEN the system SHALL replace the pawn with the chosen piece
4. WHEN the promoted piece is created THEN the system SHALL ensure it matches the pawn's color

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a chess engine user, I want the AI to automatically promote pawns to Queens when playing, so that the game can continue without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an AI player's pawn reaches promotion rank THEN the system SHALL automatically promote to Queen
2. WHEN automatic promotion occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT pause the game for user input
3. WHEN automatic promotion completes THEN the system SHALL continue normal game flow

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a chess player, I want to be able to have multiple Queens on the board through promotion, so that the game follows official chess rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pawn is promoted to Queen THEN the system SHALL allow multiple Queens of the same color on the board
2. WHEN promotion creates a new piece THEN the system SHALL update the board state correctly
3. WHEN the new piece is placed THEN the system SHALL ensure it has the correct movement capabilities
